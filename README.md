# Project Tracker

## Overview

Project Tracker is a comprehensive Spring Boot application designed for **BuildMaster** to efficiently manage projects, tasks, and developers. It provides a robust backend system with RESTful APIs for all core functionalities, along with advanced query capabilities and audit logging.

## Key Features

*   **Entity Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Projects, Tasks, and Developers.
*   **Task Assignment**: Assign and unassign tasks to developers.
*   **Pagination & Sorting**: Efficiently browse through lists of projects, developers, and tasks with support for pagination and sorting by various attributes.
*   **Transactional Operations**: Ensures data integrity using Spring's transaction management.
*   **Caching**: Improves performance for frequently accessed data using Spring Cache.
*   **Audit Logging**: All C/U/D operations on major entities (Projects, Tasks, Developers) are logged to MongoDB for auditing purposes. An endpoint (`/logs`) can be implemented to view these logs.
*   **Advanced Queries & Endpoints**:
    *   Retrieve overdue tasks.
    *   Get the top N developers based on the number of completed tasks.
    *   Find projects that currently have no tasks.
    *   Aggregate task counts by their status (overall and per project).
*   **API Documentation**: Integrated Swagger UI for interactive API documentation and testing.
*   **Email Notifications**: Automated email alerts for overdue tasks, with configurable SMTP settings. Notifications are sent daily at 8 AM and can also be triggered manually via API.

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.3.1
*   **Data Persistence**:
    *   Spring Data JPA with Hibernate (for relational data)
    *   PostgreSQL (Primary RDBMS)
    *   Spring Data MongoDB (for audit logs)
    *   MongoDB
*   **API & Web**: Spring Web (RESTful APIs)
*   **Caching**: Spring Cache (default ConcurrentMapCacheManager, configurable for others like Caffeine)
*   **Utilities**: Lombok
*   **Build Tool**: Apache Maven
*   **API Documentation**: SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI)
*   **Development Tools**: Spring Boot DevTools


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
*   Apache Maven 3.6.x or later
*   PostgreSQL server installed and running
*   MongoDB server installed and running

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ProjectTracker
    ```
2.  **Configure `application.properties`**:
    Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update the following properties with your local database credentials and settings:
    *   `spring.datasource.url` (e.g., `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db_name`)
    *   `spring.datasource.username`
    *   `spring.datasource.password`
    *   `spring.data.mongodb.uri` (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/your_audit_db_name`)

3.  **Build the project using Maven**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Using Maven Spring Boot plugin**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
2.  **From your IDE**:
    Locate the `ProjectTrackerApplication.java` class and run it as a Java application.

Once started, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints & Documentation

### Notification Endpoints

- `POST /api/tasks/notifications/send-overdue` - Manually trigger overdue task notifications
- `GET /api/tasks/overdue` - Get a paginated list of overdue tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/overdue/list` - Get a complete list of overdue tasks (non-paginated)

All API endpoints are documented using Swagger/OpenAPI.

*   **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
*   **OpenAPI v3 Spec**: [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

## Future Enhancements / To-Do

*   Introduce REST API versioning strategy.
*   Enhance caching mechanisms (e.g., configure Caffeine with Time-To-Live settings).
*   Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for all services and controllers.
*   Implement security features (e.g., Spring Security for authentication and authorization).
*   Add email templates and support for HTML emails.
*   Implement notification preferences for developers.
*   Add email delivery status tracking and retry mechanisms.

## To create a Docker container for MongoDB and create a database:
```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -v mongodb-data:/data/db mongo:6.0
```
•  Connect again anytime with: docker exec -it mongodb mongosh
•  Use specific database: use your_database_name
•  Create collections: db.your_collection.insertOne({your: "data"})
•  View collections: show collections
•  Query data: db.your_collection.find()
